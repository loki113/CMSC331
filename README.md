# CMSC331 Projet 2 Deliverables
The advisors want two more data points added somewhere to the DB, where their respective offices are located, 
and where they will meet with their student. When a student signs up for an appointment, this data should also show.
Remove redunant SQL queries
The “work screen” (or where work shows up) is too skinny, make larger or replace so text takes up more space.

The overall pages are ugly. You may add different colors. (catie)
All footers should be an inserted “include” so if a change needs to happen, all pages change.
The number of $_SESSION variables is way too high. Eliminate all but ‘userID’. If needed, some others can stay with
negotiation. The rest can pull info from the DB when needed. This is a major code addition.
